//RAII - Resource Acquisition is initialization
// Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII, is a C++ programming technique
// which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory,
// thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, 
// database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an object.


//C++ smart pointer #include<memory>//we can't do pointer arithmatic with smart pointer
//unique pointers(unique_ptr)
//shared pointers(shared_ptr)
//weak pointers(weak_ptr)
//Auto pointers(auto_ptr)
//custom deleters

//some issue with the raw pointers
